<h1>Active Directory</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a fully functional Active Directory (AD) environment using hyper-V Manager, Windows Server 2019, and Windows 10 machines. It is designed to simulate real-world IT scenarios for learning and experimentation.
<br />
<br />

## Objectives
1. Install and configure a Windows Server 2019 Domain Controller.
2. Set up users and groups in Active Directory.
3. Configure Group Policies and organizational units (OUs).
4. Enable and configure SMB for file sharing.


## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Active Directory Setup
- Group Policy Management
- Windows Server Administration
- System Networking (NAT configuration)

## Lab Setup
- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server 2019
- **User Machines**: 2 x Windows 10 Enterprise
- **Network**: NAT with internal communication between machines.

Each VM is assigned 2GB of RAM, totaling 8GB of RAM for the entire lab. The network is set to NAT for all machines to communicate internally and share the host's internet connection.
